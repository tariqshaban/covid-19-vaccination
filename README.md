Applying Machine Learning Algorithms on a COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset
==============================
This is a submission of the **semester project** for the **CIS722** course.

It contains the code necessary to conduct data exploratory methods and machine learning algorithms on a COVID-19 
vaccination dataset.

The [Our World In Data (OWID)](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) dataset has been used to
satisfy the requirements.


Getting Started
------------
Clone the project from GitHub

`$ git clone https://github.com/tariqshaban/covid-19-vaccination.git`

No further configuration is required.


Usage
